# arduinosnippets
lil' snippets of useful Arduino code!
Note: I'm not a good programmer. I just get stuff to barely work to minimum spec and call it good. This code could be heavily optimized!

teensyAudioSnippets.txt currently contains:
  Logarithmic FFT mapping (or any other float array) and the init function
    -> Maps a linear array of values logarithmically to another array of the same size. Useful for spectrum analysis.
